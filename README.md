# Solarcast
Safecast Solarcast sensor device is designed to operate off-grid and sense environmental parameters. It consists of 5 key modules designed for maximal reuse.

#Modular design
 1. Air sensor module
 2. Geiger sensor module
 3. Battery power module
 4. Communications module
 5. Gateway module

In an optimal design all modules have their own BLE processor and can be directly combined between each other, initial design is however only partially modular.
